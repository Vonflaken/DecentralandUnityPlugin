### 3DMax & glTF Exporter (excerpted from http://doc.babylonjs.com/resources/3dsmax)

Goto the github folder(https://github.com/BabylonJS/Exporters/tree/master/3ds%20Max).
Download Max2Babylon-x.x.xx.zip. That is the plugin for 3DMax
Then, extract the content of the zip file on your computer, and open the directory corresponding to your 3DS Max version. Finally, make sure 3ds Max is not running, and move all .dll files into the installation directory of 3DS Max (in C:/Programs/Autodesk/3ds Max 2015/bin/assemblies). The next time you will start 3ds Max, the plugin will be automatically launched, and a new tab should appear:
